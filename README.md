9torrent (or Btfs) was an attempt at an implementation of the BitTorrent protocol.
The primary goal was to design and program a BitTorrent client for the Plan 9 from Bell Labs operating system providing the basic functionalities found in most BitTorrent clients.
The general design and user interface was elaborated with the Plan 9 file server model in mind.

It is not finished and probably won't ever be.
